          <h5>Microstates</h5>
          <p>The simple, composable, "just JavaScript" answer to state management.</p>
          <p>If you’re used to first-generation tools like Redux, state management can have both a steep learning curve, and quickly turn into a messy business. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Microstates uses simple ES6 classes to model your state, and with its unique approach to composability makes expressing the state for even the most complex interfaces a breeze.</p>
